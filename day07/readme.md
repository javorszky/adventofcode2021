## Task 1

Here's a bunch of input and a rule: do the thing where you find the minimum.

I brute forced it. It was fast enough.

## Task 2

Same thing as above, but the rule is different.

For each distance, I need to add the sum of an increasing series: e.g. for distance of 6, I need to
add `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6`.

Remember in school you learned about one of the famous scientists who was given a task as a kid to add the first 100
numbers, teacher thinking they would take a while, and then he stood up after mere seconds because he solved the
equation.

Also remember that the way he dun it was cleverer: using a pattern.

See, 1 + 6 = 2 + 5 = 3 + 4.

1. First and last.
2. Second and second from back.
3. Third and third from back.

So with that, given a number 982, the sums up to and including that number from 1 would
be `(1 + 982) * (982/2) = 482653`.

PS: It was [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#Anecdotes).
