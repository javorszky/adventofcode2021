# Day 12

## Task 1

1. Create a bunch of nodes with links between them. It's kind of like a linked list, except branching. Ends up being a
   graph.
2. Start at the start node.
3. Start walking through all of their links, recursively, always passing where we've been so far in a slice.
4. If we're in a smol cave, and we've been there before, stop and return empty, that's a dead end.
5. If we've reached the end, return the entire path up the stack.
6. Collect at the source, then count how many paths we got back.

## Task 2

Same as above, except collect all the small caves that aren't the start, or end, create a copy of the "have we been
there" checker function, pass that to the walker, and at the end remove duplicate paths from the results, then return
the length.
