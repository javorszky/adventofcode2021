# Day 18

This is essentially binary tree whiteboarding with some story.

## Task 1

The biggest issue I was having was to parse the string into trees, and wrapping (hehe, christmas pun!) my head around how a binary tree actually works, and how I can traverse / collect stuff in it.

TLDR: have a wrapper func that sets up the data you want to colelct, and have a recursive function within that that walks down the legs if the node is not nil.

This series of articles helped me a lot: https://medium.com/geekculture/binary-tree-traversals-in-go-2bce834f449c

## Task 2

It's a brute forcing exercise. Nothing special.
