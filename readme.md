# 🎄 Advent of Code 2021 🎄

Here be solutions for aoc21 by moi!

* [Day 01](day01/) - how many increases are there? how about sliding 3 window values?
* [Day 02](day02/) - where will you end up given instructions? How about when the instructions mean a different thing?
* [Day 03](day03/) - parse binary data into error codes, filter, and whatnot
* [Day 04](day04/) - a random kraken attached itself to your sub. Maybe it wants to play bingo?
